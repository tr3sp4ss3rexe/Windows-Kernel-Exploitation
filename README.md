***I've made this repo for those who wanna get start in windows kernel exploitation and driver reversing. I'll try to give some tips to get started, share my exploits for HEVD, some PDFs, and whatever resource I find useful. Have in mind that both this repo and myself are constantly developing/improving, and hopefully this will be helpful getting you started.***

Awsome book recommendations that help mastering Windows architecture: 
- Windows kernel programming by Pavel Yosifovich
- Windows 10 programming pt. 1 by Pavel Yosifovich
- Windows 10 programming pt. 2 by Pavel Yosifovich

**Tools that I always use for driver reversing:**
- Windbg: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/
- Ida: https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/
- BinDiff: For patch diff analysis
- PoolMonEx: https://github.com/zodiacon/PoolMonX

**PDB files:** 

Program database (PDB) is a file format (developed by Microsoft) for storing debugging information about a program (or, commonly, program modules such as a DLL or EXE). PDB files commonly have a .pdb extension. A PDB file is typically created from source files during compilation. pdb file holds debugging and project state information that allows incremental linking of a Debug configuration of your app. 

Some tools used to parse PDB files and structures and gathering useful info from them: 

**pdbex:** https://github.com/wbenny/pdbex

- Usage: 
>pdbex.exe _SID ntdll.pdb

**symChk:** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symchk-command-line-options
- Usage: 
>symchk /r c:\windows\system32\[filename] /s SRV*c:\symbols\*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols

**Dia2dump(parse pdb files):** 

The Dia2dump sample shows how to use the Microsoft Debug Interface Access Software Development Kit (DIA SDK) to query a PDB file for information. The Dia2dump sample is installed with Visual Studio and contains the solution and source files. The compiled executable runs from the command line. It can display the contents of an entire program database (.pdb) file, or just the sections you're interested in.

**PDBRipper:** https://github.com/horsicq/PDBRipper

- Usage: Has a GUI and is very easy to use.

Getting started with kernel debugging: https://blog.securitybreak.io/reverse-engineering-tips-kernel-debugging-on-windows-10-784e43be7353

Some windbg commands that I found useful in my journy(There will probably be more): 
- Command help center: .hh
- List kernel data structures: dt , so to list "TOKEN" it'll be: dt nt!_TOKEN -v
- To list all the modules that have used (for example CreateFileA): x *!*createfilea*
- To fix everything lool: .reload
- .trap: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-trap--display-trap-frame-
- To monitor the kernel pool: !poolused
